# DeltaSigmaHacks
Project done by Hamza, Eric, Umar, and Makarios. We developed this website for the Delta Hacks 9 hackathon to tackle one of RBC's challenges (making the lives of new commers entering Canada easier). Our goal was to develop a website that caters to the needs of immigrants from the Middle East. To accomplish this we designed a simplistic website on figma which acted as our framework. This included things such as a news page, weather page, support groups, and more useful resources. After this framework was completed we began programming the shell of the website in html, styled in css, and finally programmed any scripting (such as the weather page) in javascript. In the future we would like to improve the look and feel of the sub pages and include ways to personalize the website to each users needs and wants.
